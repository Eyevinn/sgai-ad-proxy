# Server-Guided Ad Insertion Proxy

This application is a simple **http** proxy server that inserts ads into a video stream. It is designed to be used in conjunction with a video player (e.g., AVPlayer) that supports Server Guided Ad Insertion (SGAI). The proxy server intercepts the video stream from the origin server and inserts ads into the media playlist as interstitals at specifed timepoints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* An HLS streaming sever

```bash
# Use ffmpeg to create a simple HLS Live stream under the "test" directory
ffmpeg -y -re -stream_loop -1 -i sintel_trailer-1080p.mp4 \
  -preset slow -g 48 -sc_threshold 0 \
  -map 0:0 -map 0:1 -map 0:0 -map 0:1 \
  -s:v:0 640x360 -c:v:0 libx264 -b:v:0 365k \
  -s:v:1 960x540 -c:v:1 libx264 -b:v:1 2000k  \
  -c:a copy \
  -var_stream_map "v:0,a:0 v:1,a:1" \
  -master_pl_name master.m3u8 \
  -f hls -hls_time 4 -hls_list_size 8 -hls_flags round_durations+program_date_time+delete_segments \
  -hls_segment_filename "test/v%v/fileSequence%d.ts" test/v%v/media.m3u8

# Serve the HLS Live stream using a simple http server *above* the "test" directory
python -m http.server 8001

# Now you can access the HLS stream at http://127.0.0.1:8001/test/master.m3u8
```

* A running instance of the [ad-server](https://github.com/Eyevinn/test-adserver).
For example, one test ad server is available at <https://eyevinn-sgai.eyevinn-test-adserver.auto.prod.osaas.io/api/v1/vast>

* AvPlayer or any other video player that supports Server Guided Ad Insertion (SGAI)

```bash
# Once the ad-proxy server is running (e.g., on port 3333), 
# you can use AVPlayer to play the HLS stream
```

### Run

```bash
# Start the ad-proxy server on port 3333 with the origin HLS stream at http://localhost:8001/loop/master.m3u8
# 1. Use test ad server at https://eyevinn-sgai.eyevinn-test-adserver.auto.prod.osaas.io/api/v1/vast with query parameters dur, uid, ps, min, and max
# Here the [template.*] will be replaced with the actual values before sending the request to the ad server while the rest will be passed as is
# 2. Use dynamic mode to insert ads into the HLS Live stream at specified timepoints
# 3. Use http://localhost:3333 as the base URL for interstitals (by default)
cargo run --bin ad_proxy 127.0.0.1 3333 http://localhost:8001/test/master.m3u8 \
https://eyevinn-sgai.eyevinn-test-adserver.auto.prod.osaas.io/api/v1/vast?dur=[template.duration]&uid=[template.sessionId]&ps=[template.pod]&min=5&max=5 \
--ad-insertion-mode dynamic

# Now you can access the HLS Live stream at http://127.0.0.1:3333/test/master.m3u8
# NOTE: Each proxy server instance can only handle one HLS Live stream at a time and restart is required to switch streams
```

For more options, run `ad_proxy --help`

```bash
Usage: ad_proxy [OPTIONS] <LISTEN_ADDR> <LISTEN_PORT> <MASTER_PLAYLIST_URL> <AD_SERVER_ENDPOINT>

Arguments:
  <LISTEN_ADDR>          Proxy address (ip)
  <LISTEN_PORT>          Proxy port
  <MASTER_PLAYLIST_URL>  HLS stream address (protocol://ip:port/path)
                         e.g., http://localhost/test/master.m3u8)
  <AD_SERVER_ENDPOINT>   Ad server endpoint (protocol://ip:port/path)
                         It should be a VAST4.0/4.1 XML compatible endpoint

Options:
  -a, --ad-insertion-mode <AD_INSERTION_MODE>
          Ad insertion mode to use:
          1) static  - add intertistial every 30 seconds (100 in total).
          2) dynamic - add intertistial when requested (Live Content only). [default: static] [possible values: static, dynamic]
  -i, --interstitals-address <INTERSTITALS_ADDRESS>
          Base URL for interstitals (protocol://ip:port)
          If not provided, the server will use 'localhost' and the 'listen port' as the base URL
          e.g., http://localhost:${LISTEN_PORT} [default: ]
```

### Insert Ads

One can insert ads into the video stream by sending a GET request to the ad-proxy server with the following query parameters:

* in - the time in seconds when the ad break should be inserted
* duration - the duration of the ad break in seconds
* pod_num - the number of creatives in this ad break

For example, to insert an ad break at 5 seconds from the live-edge with a duration of 10 seconds and 2 creatives, one would send the following request:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3333/command?in=5&dur=10&pod=2
```

It is also possible to check the status of the proxy server by sending a GET request:  

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3333/status
```

### Example JSON response for interstitials

``` json
{
   "ASSETS":[
      {
         "URI":"http://localhost:3333/interstitials.m3u8?_HLS_interstitial_id=ad_slot0&_HLS_primary_id=40FE1829-438E-49B0-8B3A-A285DD4A8154&_HLS_start_offset=0&_HLS_follow_id=361434bf-05e7-4e17-83ca-690452e1cb33",
         "DURATION":5
      },
      {
         "URI":"http://localhost:3333/interstitials.m3u8?_HLS_interstitial_id=ad_slot0&_HLS_primary_id=40FE1829-438E-49B0-8B3A-A285DD4A8154&_HLS_start_offset=5&_HLS_follow_id=eb805a34-1d61-4217-9632-deab8790c30d",
         "DURATION":5
      }
   ]
}
```

## Limitations

* In order to place the interstitials at the correct timepoints, the origin media playlist must contain the `EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME` tag. Otherwise, no interstitials will be inserted (the origin media playlist will be returned).
* The creatives from ad server are mostly regular MPEG-4 files (ftyp+moov+mdat). While AVPlayer can handle regular MP4 files, other video player like hls.js can only handle fragmented MPEG-4 files (ftyp+moov+moof+mdat+moof+mdat+â€¦). Therefore, it would fail to play out the interstitials.
For better support, one might have to transcode the creatives to fragmented MPEG-4 or ts files first. Ideally, it is also suggested to transcode the creatives to multiple bitrates to support adaptive bitrate streaming.
* Joining the live stream during an ad break might pause the playback until the ad break is over.
* Long-duration creatives (e.g., more than 15 seconds) from test ad server might be too large for AVPlayer to download. In such cases, the interstitials might be skipped.
* The proxy server can only handle one HLS stream at a time. To switch streams, the server must be restarted.
